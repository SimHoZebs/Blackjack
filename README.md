This is my clone of the game Blackjack, with a little change.

The following link is the basic blackjack rule:
https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-play-blackjack/

The followings are the key difference of the game:
- You do not buy chips, but instead pay with your game money, which starts at $100.
- There are no players but you.
- The dealer bets equal amount of money as the player.
- If one of the player goes broke, the other player wins.

For any ideas for change and/or to submit bug, please use the link above or the issue tab of this project. Thank you!
